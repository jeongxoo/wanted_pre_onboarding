AI is short for artificial intelligence, a term coined by John McCarthy in 1955 at Dartmouth College. It is related to the work of Alan Turing, who in 1950 developed the Turing test, which evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit behavio requivalent to, or indistinguishable from, a human. The scientific study of AI aims to develop computer hardware and software which emulates processes of the human brain, including the processing of photographic images and human languages.
Analog or analogue is an electronic communication sent as signals of varying frequency instead of ON or OFF like a digital data transmission. Analog allows equipment to handle information that continuously changes such as voltage, current, and wave. The picture to the right is an example of an analog signal or how analog may be represented. In the example of a wave, it has a high and low value with numerous values in-between. With a digital wave, it would have a high or low value (on or off), with nothing in-between.
Initially founded by Andy Rubin in October 2003 and later acquired by Google on August 17, 2005. Android is a free Linux based platform and is an open software stack with an operating system, middleware, and applications. It was originally devel oped by Google and released on November 5, 2007, for mobile platforms. The T-Mobile's G1 phone (HTC Dream) is the first phone to be released to the public with Google Android on September 23, 2008. Android is a strong rival to the Apple iOS, a closed operating system and platform used on the Apple iPhone.
An archive is a site or location that has a vast amount of information about a topic that can be downloaded or browsed. Archives can be used to research and learn more about the topic being discussed. For example, Computer Hope can be considered an archive of computer information. Archive is another term used to describe a file that contains multiple files that are usually compressed files. The Internet Archive is a non-profit that was founded in 1996 that's been backing up web pages since it was founded and now also stores old texts, audio, moving images, and software.
When referring to computers, architecture or computer architecture is their overall design and layout. Architecture includes where connections and parts of the computer are to be placed, how each of components operate with each other, dimensions, etc. CPU architecture is very similar, except it deals with how the many components of a processor are arranged and work together, as well as how far apart the transistors are.
In general, a back-end task or operation is one that is performed in the background, without a user's awareness or direct interaction. In programming and development, the back-end is a term that describes a person who designs and develops programs and scripts that process data and perform tasks the user doesn't see. For example, a website's back-end developer is responsible for how the server sends information to visitors. In contrast, a front-end developer is responsible for how that information is presented, and how users may interact with it.
Alternatively referred to as a manhole or trapdoor, a backdoor is a term used to describe a hidden method of bypassing security to gain access to a restricted part of a computer system. For example, a programmer may insert a piece of code that would allow them a ccess to a computer or secure area using a password that only they know.
Bluetooth is a computing and telecommunications industry specification that describes how devices can communicate with each other. Devices that use Bluetooth include computers, a computer keyboard and mouse, person al digital assistants, and smartphones.
Bluetooth is an RF technology that operates at 2.4 GHz, has an effective range of 32-feet (10 meters) (this range can change depending on the power class), and has a transfer rate of 1 Mbps and throughput of 721 Kbps.
Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor, the CPU (pronounced sea-pea-you) is the central processing unit of the computer. A computer's CPU handles all instructions it receives from hardware and software running on the computer.
Cloud computing is a term used to describe services provided over a network by a collection of remote servers. This abstract "cloud" of computers provides massive, distributed storage and processing power, which can be accessed by any Internet-connected device running a web browser.
